# graphing-data
Work consisting of varying ways to graph data.

First project: Audio Spectrogram
  Using Python and Plotly
    Read in sample data of a song and parsed it into a 2D array with amplitude as a function of time and frequency. 
    Made the 2D array spectrogram of the sample song by plotting onto a heatmap.
    This is part of the process of creating an audio fingerprint for audio recognition.
